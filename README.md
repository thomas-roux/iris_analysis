## 1. Who was Fisher?
Ronald Aylmer Fisher was born in London, England in 1890. He went on to become a prolific author in statistics and genetics, with over 400 academic papers, and many advances in the field of statistics attributed to his name. Some of his key discoveries are noted below:

* 1912 -	Established that a sample mean is different from a population mean
* 1918 - 	Introduced the novel concept of variance
* 1919 - 	Progressed the field of statistics by inventing the tools of modern experimental design
* 1921 - 	Created the statistical method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
* 1922 - 	Developed the method of ‘maximum likelihood’, a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations.
* 1924 - 	Created the F distribution for use in ANOVA
* 1925 -	Published Statistical Methods for Research Workers, a book considered on par with Isaac Newton’s Principia in physics.
* 1930 - 	Released The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, unifying the theory of natural selection with Mendel’s laws of inheritance.
* 1933 -	Discovered the Rhesus blood group system, and established the Fisher-Race notation for Rhesus phenotypes and genotypes. 
* 1935 - 	Published The Design of Experiments, introducing the null hypothesis.
* 1952 -	Knighted by the Queen

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher died in 1962, having rightly earned himself a place as one of the imminent scientists of the 20th century.
